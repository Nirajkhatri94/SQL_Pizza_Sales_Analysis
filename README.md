# Pizza Sales Analysis
Hello, I am Niraj Khatri.

In this project, **Pizza_sales_analysis**, I focus on analyzing pizza sales data to understand sales performance, customer preferences, and revenue patterns. This analysis is critical for businesses aiming to improve profitability, and operational efficiency, and make data-driven decisions.

---

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to perform an in-depth analysis of pizza sales data, which helps businesses in:
- Understanding sales performance trends over time.
- Identifying customer preferences regarding pizza types, sizes, and best-selling items.
- Evaluating revenue patterns and performance across different periods.

## Project Contents
This repository contains:
1. **Data**: A table in the form of a **.zip file** that contains the dataset.
2. **CSV Import Script**: A Python script that demonstrates how to **import CSV** data into a **MySQL database**.
3. **Question Text File**: The list of questions corresponding to each SQL query.
4. **SQL File**: The SQL file that includes the 13 queries used to analyze the data.

## How to Use This Project
### Step 1: Setup

1. **Download the Dataset**:
   - The dataset is provided in a **.zip file**. Download and extract the contents to get access to the data.

2. **Import the Data into MySQL**:
   - Use the **Python script** to import the CSV data into your MySQL database. Ensure that your MySQL server is running and the required tables are created before importing.
   - The Python script is designed to handle the CSV-to-MySQL import process seamlessly. 

3. **Run SQL Queries**:
   - Open the **SQL file** containing the 13 queries in your preferred SQL editor (e.g., SQLyog, MySQL Workbench, or directly in MySQL).
   - Execute the queries to analyze the data based on the predefined scenarios.
   - Each query corresponds to a specific business question, and the results will help you gain insights into the sales patterns.

## Queries and Scenarios
Hereâ€™s a brief description of what the SQL queries address:

1. **Sales Trends**: Understanding how sales have performed over different time periods.
2. **Customer Preferences**: Identifying the most popular pizzas, and sizes.
3. **Revenue Analysis**: Evaluating the total revenue generated, and  Analyzing which pizza size (small, medium, large) is most commonly ordered.
4. **Operational Efficiency**: Finding patterns in sales that may indicate areas for operational improvement.
5. **Profitability**: Assessing profit margins for different pizza types or categories.
